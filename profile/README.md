# FarmData2

FarmData2 aims to extend farmOS by adding data input forms, 
reporting, and analytics that support the day-to-day operation of 
diversified vegetable farms, while also
facilitating the keeping of records necessary for organic certification 
and for the study of sustainable farming practices.
